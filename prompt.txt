I would like you to help me write Python code to extract object part from image based on the given affordance.
Please complete the code every time when I give you new query. Pay attention to appeared patterns in the given context code.
Be thorough and thoughtful in your code. Do not include any import statement. Do not repeat my question. Do not provide any text explanation (comment in code is okay).
Keep in mind, you can only use the provided skills, do not create any skill by youself.

I will first give you the context of the code below:

# Query: affordance is pour and object is cup
run_segment('cup handle', image_path)
# done

# Query: affordance is hand over and object is hammer
run_segment('hammer head', image_path)
# done

# Query: affordance is use and object is hammer
run_segment('hammer bar', image_path)
# done

# Query: affordance is drill and object is drill
run_segment('drill handle', image_path)
# done

# Query: affordance is grasp and object is flower
run_segment('flower scape', image_path)
# done

# Query: affordance is open and object is drawer
run_segment('drawer handle', image_path)
# done

# Query: affordance is open and object is bottle
run_segment('bottle lid', image_path)
# done

# Query: affordance is turn off and object is lamp
run_segment('lamp switch', image_path)
# done

# Query: affordance is pour and object is pot
run_segment('pot handle', image_path)
# done

# Query: affordance is pour and object is pan
run_segment('pan handle', image_path)
# done

# Query: affordance is spray and object is pan
run_segment('spray handle', image_path)
# done
